## Claude Chat

A simple chat application framework that uses the Claude API. It separates out code and saves it to files. It uses the PyQt5 library for the gui.

## Notes

This is a starting point to build local custom chat clients with tight integration with an ide or application.

## Requirements

PyQt5 is the big requirement, and of course the anthropic library.

```pip install anthropic```

```pip install pyqt5```
