## Claude Chat

A simple chat application framework that uses the Claude API and uses the PyQt5 library for the gui.

It separates out code and saves it to files.

## Notes

This is a starting point to build local custom chat clients with tight integration with an ide or application.

## Requirements

PyQt5 is the big requirement, and of course the anthropic library.

```pip install anthropic```

```pip install pyqt5```
